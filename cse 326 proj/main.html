            <h2 id="text-head"><u> Ways to Save Electricity!!! </u></h2>
            <pre class="para1"> 
        <b>1. Switch to energy-efficient light bulbs: </b><br>
        Switching to energy-efficient bulbs is an easy way to save shed-loads of electricity. 
        The traditional types – known as incandescent bulbs – only convert 10% of the energy used to power them into light. 
        The rest is lost as heat!
        <br>

        <b></b> 2. Turn off appliances on standby: <br></b>
        According to the Energy Saving Trust, the average UK household spends £35 a year on appliances left on standby.
        This is because, when you leave devices like TVs or stereos on standby, rather than switching them off, they still
        use power. But there’s an easy solution – turn them off at the mains when you’re not using them! <br>

        <b>3. Be more energy-efficient with your fridge and freezer: <br></b>
        Clean the coils – it might not come top of the list of chores, but the coils at the back of your fridge get dirty
        over time. Wiping them clean can make a big difference in boosting the energy-efficiency of your fridge. According
        to the Consumer Energy Center, doing this could actually lower your fridge’s energy use by as much as 30%. Time to
        get scrubbing!
        Keep them full –  by keeping your fridge and freezer at least three-quarters full, you can make sure that they don’t
        waste energy heating empty air. But remember, don’t cram them too full either – this could stop air from circulating,
        which will also use more energy. 


        <b>4. Be more efficient when cooking: <br></b>
        As you’d expect, if you spend less time cooking, you’ll use less energy. So it’s worth thinking about how you can
        change your cooking habits when you’re making dinner. Try making these small changes:
        Heat water in a kettle rather than on the hob.

        <b>5. Wash your clothes on a lower temperature:  <br></b>
        Simply by moving down the dial on your washing machine, you can make huge energy savings. According to the Energy
        Saving Trust, washing your clothes at  30˚C will save you 40% of the energy used washing at higher temperatures. 
        And a study by Which? found that if the whole of the UK switched to washing at 30˚C, it would cut 388,000 tonnes 
        of carbon – the equivalent of taking more than 388,000 cars off the road.
        Nowadays, modern detergents are able to get just as good results at lower temperatures. So there’s no reason not 
        to make the change and start washing at 30˚C.

        <b>6. Air dry your clothes: <br></b>
        If you have a tumble dryer, it can be tempting to use it all the time. But on a sunny day, it’s always worth hanging 
        up your clothes outside if you can. They’ll dry quicker, and it’ll save you money.

        <b>7. Use natural light: <br> </b>
        It might seem obvious, but opening the curtains can help to cut down on electricity. Of course, solar power is an
        amazing way to generate electricity – but just by letting in more sunlight, we can cut back on how much we use our
        lights indoors. Plus, it’ll give you an extra dose of vitamin D! And don’t forget to turn off lights when you’re 
        not using them, as this can save you £15 a year8. 
        But remember, when it’s dark, it’s just as important to keep those curtains closed. This will stop warmth from 
        escaping, so you can use less heating and keep bills down.

        <b>8. Don’t overfill your kettle: <br> <b></b>
        If you’re making a cup of tea, only fill the kettle with the amount of water you need. This way, you won’t use 
        any unnecessary energy boiling it, and your cuppa will be ready quicker. According to the Energy Saving Trust,
        this can save you £6 a year – which could buy you around 500 tea bags!
